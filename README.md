# Welcome to the Power Hub repository!

Power Hub is a decentralized application and content distribution platform within the Power DCloud ecosystem. It allows for the distribution of apps and content to end users in a decentralized manner.

Key features of Power Hub include:

- Decentralized wallet
- Account management
- A marketplace for dapps and NFTs (non-fungible tokens)
- Tools for developers to create and distribute their applications
- Tools for end users to discover and interact with dapps
- Tools for maintainers to manage and update their applications
- Tools for DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) contributors to participate in the development and governance of the platform

We hope you find the resources here helpful in creating and distributing your own dapps within the Power DCloud ecosystem.
